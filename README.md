 <h1 align='center'>Hi, ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Matteo, </h1>
 <h3 align="center">Developer from Italy</h3>

<p>Growing up i was always passionate by technologies, innovations and graphics in general, that's why after an experience in London in a busy and stimulating environment in the wine sector, i decided to follow my true passion and complete the Odin Project curriculum.

 In this curriculum i learned and worked with <em background-color='orange'>React, Javascript(ES6+), HTML and CSS </em>  for the front-end, <em> NodeJs, EXPRESS, MongoDB and Firebase </em> for the back-end, all of this to deliver great looking and performig website and App.

 I have a profound love for <em>problem solving </em> , which is at the root of why I enjoy programming so much! I thrive in environments that challenge me, and allow me to grow and develop my skills.

Committed to the idea of life-long learning, I am ready to collaborate on new and exciting projects!</p>
